More dependable and potent anti-spam filters are now required due to the rise in the volume of unsolicited emails, or spam. Nowadays, spam emails have been efficiently detected and filtered using machine learning algorithms. For this sort of categorization, there are several methods available in the field of natural language processing. Spam emails typically contain a few words that are easily recognisable and serve as relatively clear signs that the email is spam.

Every email correspondence is often classified as "Ham" or "Spam." Spam messages are undesired bulk or commercial messages, whereas Ham communications are intended or safe permitted messages in a mailbox. This separation of email communications into "Ham" and "Spam" categories, or filtering, helps automate the elimination of spam messages. The identification of spam emails often depends on a number of factors or elements. The illustration below demonstrates how a common spam detection generally operates.
